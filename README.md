# SQL-Project-SQL-QUERIES-FOR-PATIENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-

In this project, I developed a Patient Management System designed to streamline the management of patient
information, billing, and healthcare services within an NHS context. The system enables healthcare providers to
efficiently store, update, and retrieve patient data while ensuring secure handling of sensitive information.
To achieve this, I implemented a series of SQL queries that perform essential database operations such as:
• Creating tables for storing patient, appointment, and billing information.
• Inserting data to add new patients, services, and transaction records.
• Updating records to reflect changes in patient details or billing status.
• Deleting records when necessary, such as removing outdated or incorrect entries.
• Retrieving data using queries to fetch patient information, appointments, and billing history for real-time
access by healthcare staff.
This system ensures compliance with NHS data management protocols while enhancing the efficiency of patient
care and administrative processes.
